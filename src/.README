We have chose to implement as a new design couple of exhausts in a grey color. implemented in the back render function.
Important implementation notes and why we have choosed to work that way.
-GetBoundingSpheres - implemented regardless of the length of th list, even though we only have one Sphere per
car part, we believe it will be relevant in next HW.
